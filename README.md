# Installation Guide

This guide will walk you through the steps to install and run the Spotify Data Analysis project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have a recent version of Python installed (3.7 or later is recommended).
- You have a basic understanding of how to use the command line on your computer.

## Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   Open your terminal and use `git` to clone the repository. Replace `your-username` and `your-repository` with your GitHub username and the name of your repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git

Navigate into the cloned repository:

    cd your-repository

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**

   It's often a good idea to create a virtual environment for your Python projects to isolate the dependencies for each project. You can create a virtual environment using the venv module that comes with Python:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env

And then activate the virtual environment. On macOS and Linux:
    
    source env/bin/activate

On Windows:
    
    .\env\Scripts\activate

3. **Install the required packages**

    The project comes with a requirements.txt file that lists all the Python packages that the project depends on. You can install all these packages using pip:

     ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Set up your Spotify API credentials**

    You will need to create an application on the Spotify Developer Dashboard to get the client_id, client_secret, and redirect_uri that the project needs. Once you have these, add them to a .env file in the root directory of the project:

    ```bash
    SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID='your-spotify-client-id'
    SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET='your-spotify-client-secret'
    SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI='your-spotify-redirect-uri'

Replace 'your-spotify-client-id', 'your-spotify-client-secret', and 'your-spotify-redirect-uri' with your actual Spotify API credentials.

5.**Run the project**

You can now run the project:

    python main.py
